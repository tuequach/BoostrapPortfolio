            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>
                I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and moved to America when I was eight.
                I lived in Los Angeles, California for about a year and have been a resident in Austin, Texas since
                then.
                My alma matter is Texas A&M University, where I received my Bachelor of Science in Sociology with a
                minor in
                Game Designs and Development.
                I've been coding for about 2 years and I initially thought that I wanted to focus mainly on Game
                Developemnent
                only (had done a few gaming projects on the side).
                However, my future goal is to become a Full Stack Software Developer and learning more about our
                intricite
                technology.
                On my free time, I enjoy watching anime (Plus Ultra!) and play video games online (League of Legends,
                Smash, etc.).
                I love traveling and learning new things about the world.
